# Williams System 11 Interconnect board

This is a replacement interconnect board for use in Williams System 11B
pinball machines. The original part number is D-12313-x (x varies per
game).

Each game has a specific combination of resistor values, jumpers, and
populated connectors. See the manual for each game to know what the
appropriate values are, and which connectors need to be populated.

Swords of Fury and Taxi use a slightly older version of this board that
doesn't have the optocouplers at U2 and U3.

Version 1.0 of this design was tested successfully in Diner.

Change history:  
1.0 - Initial version  
1.1 - Moved some traces further away from J19  

To Do:  
- Clean up the schematic, goal was to make a PCB, not a schematic.  
- Modify Molex connector footprints to make pads longer
